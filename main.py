voice.say("However I feel I lack the understanding of the basics of ML and hence I am not able to comprehend the articles very well. So I want to do a course that covers the fundamental topics of this field.")
voice.say("Being a student, I have no income of myself. I could have done internships and use the stipend to pay for this course, but currently my personal and college expenses are already very high which leaves behind a very small amount as savings. With my deep interest in the field,")

voice.say("I plan to use this course to improve my knowledge about the fundamentals of Machine Learning and Data Science. I plan to eventually specialise in Deep Learning after having learnt and practiced the basics well enough. I read that this course also includes several practice assignments and a project")
voice.say("doing which would be immensely beneficial to the improvement of my practical skills in this area. Completing this course would also provide me the confidence to dive deep into data science and take on further challenging assignments. All of this would greatly help me in achieving my career goals in future and also help me in eventually getting a data science job.")
